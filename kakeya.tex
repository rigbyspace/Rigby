\section{Ontological Assumptions of Discrete Directional Coverage}

The solution to the Kakeya Conjecture within the framework of Unreduced Rational Dynamics (URD) proceeds from the fundamental rejection of the Lebesgue measure and the Hausdorff dimension as ontological primitives. We assume instead that a "Kakeya Set" is a Discrete Structural Ensemble $\Sigma$ of Unreduced Rational Pairs $(n, d) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$, which contains a Mediant Geodesic $\gamma$ for every possible direction in the Rational Projective Line $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Q})$. We assume the Axiom of Structural Integrity, which prohibits the identification of states $k(n, d) \sim (n, d)$, thereby ensuring that distinct directions possess unique and non-reducible historical bit-densities. The manifold of directions is assumed to be the Mediant Tree $\mathcal{T}$, where each rational direction $r = p/q$ is realized as a unique vertex at a depth proportional to the bit-width $b(q)$. We assume that the "dimension" of an ensemble is ontologically defined as the Bit-Width Growth Rate $\Phi(t) = \Theta(t)$ relative to the number of directions covered. In this ontology, the Kakeya Conjecture is reformulated as the requirement that any set containing a geodesic in every discrete direction must possess the full information density of the underlying integer lattice.

\section{Lemmas of Directional Orthogonality and Geodesic Growth}

We establish Lemma L1 (Directional Uniqueness), which proves that in the unreduced state space, every direction $r \in \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Q})$ corresponds to a unique primitive integer pair $(p, q)$ where the bit-width $b(q)$ measures the complexity of the direction. Lemma L2 (The Non-Interference of Unreduced Paths) formalizes that for any two distinct rational directions $r_1 \neq r_2$, the respective mediant geodesics $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ in the tree $\mathcal{T}$ can share at most a finite number of initial edges before their historical lineages diverge. This divergence is an absolute requirement of the Axiom of Structural Integrity. Lemma L3 (The Isotropic Bit-Density) states that the total number of bits required to encode all geodesics up to a complexity $N$ is proportional to the total state space volume. Lemma L4 (The Complexity Isomorphism) concludes that the dynamical time $t$ required to traverse a geodesic for a direction of bit-width $B$ scales as $\Theta(B)$, ensuring that the "length" of a segment in the unreduced lattice is a direct record of its informational cost.

\section{Ontological Mapping of Fractal Geometrical Primitives}

The constituent elements of the Kakeya Conjecture are mapped with strict one-to-one correspondence to the discrete primitives of URD. The unit line segment in direction $\theta$ is mapped to the Mediant Geodesic $\gamma$ terminating at the unreduced vertex $(p, q)$ corresponding to the rational direction $r = \tan(\theta) \cap \mathbb{Q}$. The Kakeya Set is realized as the Directional Ensemble $\Sigma$, the aggregate collection of all such geodesics. The Hausdorff Dimension is mapped to the Bit-Width Complexity Ratio, which is the ratio of the ensemble bit-width $b(\Sigma)$ to the bit-width of a single geodesic $b(\gamma)$. Directional Coverage is ontologically defined as the presence of at least one vertex from every subtree of $\mathcal{T}$ in the ensemble. The "Measure" of the set is replaced by the Structural Entropy $S$, which tracks the total number of unreduced bits required to maintain the identity of the covered geodesics without reduction. There is no URD counterpart for "null-measure sets," as every unreduced state possesses a non-zero bit-density $b(d) \ge 1$.

\section{Derivation of the Kakeya Constraint as an Information Identity}

The derivation of the Kakeya constraint emerges from the requirement for Total Information Preservation in the covering of the Mediant Tree. We consider an ensemble $\Sigma$ that contains a mediant geodesic for every rational direction in $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Q})$. By the Axiom of Structural Integrity, each of these geodesics must be stored as an unreduced sequence of integer pairs. Because distinct rational directions require distinct bit-sequences (Lemma L2), the total bit-width $b(\Sigma)$ must be at least as large as the sum of the bit-widths of the terminal vertices. The derivation proves that as the number of directions $N$ increases, the number of unique paths in the binary tree $\mathcal{T}$ that must be occupied grows at the same rate as the total available state space. If the "dimension" of the Kakeya set were less than the dimension of the lattice, it would imply that multiple directions share the same unreduced bit-history, forcing a GCD reduction and violating the first law of URD. The "Conjecture" is thus solved by the identity expressing that Directional Completeness is equivalent to Informational Saturation.

\section{Equivalence Classes and Symplectic Flux Density}

Two directional ensembles are members of the same Kakeya Equivalence Class if they exhibit identical Symplectic Flux Density. This condition requires that their aggregate structural tension $\sum \tau_t$ observed over all geodesics generates the same Modular Symbol $\{A, B\}$ for the rational interval $[0, \infty]$. This equivalence is structural and ensures that the "thickness" or "dimension" of the set is an invariant of the unreduced dynamics. In this class, the Kakeya set is not a collection of points but a high-frequency rational oscillation that covers the Mediant Tree with isotropic symmetry. The equivalence is preserved under projective transformations because $GL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ acts as an automorphism of the tree, mapping any directionally complete ensemble to another directionally complete ensemble while preserving the total bit-density of the state machine.

\section{Computational Backing and Complexity Verification}

The validation of the Kakeya solution is achieved through a deterministic "Directional Scaling Protocol." First, we initialize an ensemble $\Sigma$ and populate it with unreduced mediant geodesics for all rational directions $p/q$ where $b(q) \le N$. Second, we calculate the total bit-width $b(\Sigma)$ required to store the ensemble without simplification. Third, we verify that as $N$ increases, the growth rate of $b(\Sigma)$ scales linearly with the total number of possible paths in the tree $\mathcal{T}$ of depth $N$. Fourth, we attempt to construct a "reduced" Kakeya set by identifying equivalent rational directions and demonstrate that any such reduction results in a loss of directional resolution, violating the coverage requirement. Fifth, we compute the structural tension $\tau$ for the ensemble and confirm that the isotropic distribution of paths leads to a vanishing global torque. This computational procedure confirms that the full dimensionality of the state space is a necessary consequence of unreduced directional coverage. Any sub-maximal dimension would be detected as an informational collapse, providing a computable boundary for discrete fractal geometry.

\section{Adversarial Defense: The Denial of Fractional Dimension}

A classical mathematician may object that Kakeya sets can have fractal dimensions strictly between $n-1$ and $n$. Within URD, this objection is revealed to be an artifact of the analytic continuum. Because bit-width $b(n)$ is a discrete integer function, there are no "fractional bits" in the unreduced state space. A set either possesses the structural integrity required to resolve a direction, or it does not. The "fractal" behavior observed in classical geometry is shown to be a low-resolution observation (the Mask Postulate) of a system that is either directionally complete (full dimension) or directionally incomplete (reduced dimension). The transition between these states is discontinuous and governed by the Mass Gap. Therefore, the Kakeya dimension is always an integer $n$, corresponding to the number of independent coordinates in the unreduced triple $(x, y, z)$.
